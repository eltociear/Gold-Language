# Gold-Language
The **Gold** Programming Language is an Programming Language designed to be really easy to
edit and overall just being an very Permeable coding Language.

## Setup

The **Gold** Language uses the Following Packages:

```javascript
npm i prompt
```

```javascript
npm i open
```


### Programming
**Gold** is ran inside of the **.gold** file extension, so your directory would look something like this:   

*tutorials*
*modules*   
*node_modules*  
*index.js*  
*package-lock.json*   
*package.json*   
**program.gold**   
*README.md*    

The **.gold** file is your program.   

Your **Gold** Program is interpreted using the interpreter you have, or the default one if you don't have a one.

An Basic **Gold** Program would look something like this:

```javascript
var myGoldProgram = {
    name: "Example Gold Program",
    des: "An Example Gold Program for the README file.",
    ex: [
        {
            fun: "log",
            val1: "Hello World!"
        }
    ]
};

export { myGoldProgram };
```
