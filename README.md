# Gold-Language
The **Gold** Programming Language is an Programming Language designed to be really easy to
edit and overall just being an very Permeable coding Language.

## Programming
**Gold** is ran inside of the **.gold** file extension, so your directory would look something like this:   

*tutorials*
*modules*   
*node_modules*  
*index.js*  
*package-lock.json*   
*package.json*   
**program.gold**   
*README.md*    

The **.gold** file is your program.   

Your **Gold** Program is interpreted using whatever interpreter you want, or the default one if you don't have a preference.

For an coding tutorial, go into the **tutorials** folder and check out some of the files inside of there.
