# Contributing

Hey There,   
We are excited to see that you want to help with the **Gold** programming language. The following are some ways that you can contribute to the language.   
There are many ways that you can Contribute to this project, with many types of things you can create.  

## Scripts 

Scripts are basic Functions that you can use to execute any type of code, this includes:   

```javascript
export function helloWorld() {

  console.log("Hello World!");

}
```

These Scripts can be used in any of your .Js files, including interpreters, and **index.js**.

### Interpreters

Interpreters can be used to read your **.gold** file. Take for example, the default Interpreter.

This interpreter just has some basic commands that you can run.

If you want to make your own interpreter with custom commands, put them inside of the */interpreters* folder.
